The folder contains 16 academic topics that are used for knowledge temperature experiment.
Topic citation relations are collected from academic databases including DBLP, arXiv, Elsevier and Springer. 
Each topic is led by an article that have had a profound influence in certain domains. We refer to these papers as pioneering papers or leading papers.
A scientific topic includes a pioneering paper, all the articles that directly cites it and all the citations among them.
